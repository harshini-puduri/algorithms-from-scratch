# Algorithms from Scratch


I absolutely love understanding how how things work the way they do and what makes them different!
So, this repo is just me rebuilding core AI + ML algorithms from the ground up with no libraries, just NumPy (and sometimes pandas).
I'd recommend using this as a study source. And I'll make sure to update it as soon as possible!

### Includes:
- Optimisation algorithms (batch GD + stochastic GD)
- Neural Nets (perceptron trick)
- NLP (jaccard similarity, cbow)

All code is self-contained, commented, and written to learn.
