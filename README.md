# ðŸ¤– Algorithms from Scratch

This repo is me rebuilding core AI + ML algorithms from the ground up â€” no libraries, just NumPy (and sometimes pandas).

Iâ€™m doing this to understand how things work under the hood.

### Includes:
- Gradient Descent (batch + stochastic)
- Perceptron Trick

All code is self-contained, commented, and written to learn.

Built with Python 3.  
No frameworks.
